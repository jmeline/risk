 *    Description:  Runs games as requested, and handles MPI communication and such
					NOTE: This class may not be neccecary:  We may put it all in TrueMain.
						The advantage of having it here, however, is the ability to separate non-changing parts, so that TrueMain can be adapted to specific runs without harm.

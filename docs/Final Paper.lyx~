History
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Risk was originally produced by parker brothers, now a division of hasbro.
 It was invented by the French film director Albert Lamorisse in 1957 and
 it was originally called “The Conquest of the World.”

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The creator of the game anticipated that it should take 90 minutes to complete,
 but many players end up with the board occupying their tables for days
 at a time.

 With varying strategies and fragile alliances, Risk can be a drawn-out,
 yet intellectually fulfilling game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Rules
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Risk is a turn-based for two to six players.
 In the standard Risk Game, Earth has six continents and 42 regions.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the start of the game, players choose countries into which they place
 one army.
 This is the claiming phase.
 Only one army may be placed in any region during the claiming phase.
 At the beginning of each player's turn (after the claiming phase) they
 will receive bonus troops for continents that they own completely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After claiming, players will then place armies into regions that they own.
 This happens, again, one at a time until everyone has placed all their
 starting armies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then players may choose to attack other regions.
 They may only attack bordering regions.
 Attackers can use up to three dice, if they have at least three troops.
 Otherwise, they may only use one die for each troop.
 Defenders roll up to two dice.
 The attacker and the defender then sort their dice and compare them.
 (Attacker's highest vs defender's highest AND attacker's second highest
 vs defender's second highest) For each die that is greater in this comparison,
 that player kills one opposing army in the battle.
 Defenders win ties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In most versions of Risk, there is some sort of card system.
 Players could trade in cards for armies or attempt to accomplish some secret
 mission as dictated by the cards for an even larger army bonus.
 To simplify the problem that we were approaching, we decided to omit the
 use of cards in our project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Project Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many, many strategies for risk.
 What we have worked to do in this project is to compare several of those
 strategies: Some strategies work exceptionally well in one circumstance
 but perform poorly in another.
 Which strategies work against which, and is there actually any absolute
 winner? How likely are the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

best
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 algorithms to actually win? Are there loops in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dominion graph
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? These are some of the questions that we seek to answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to achieve all of this, we're going to need a LOT of data--thousands
 of runs for every condition-identical game we wish to assess--and each
 game may take a while to run.
 Since there are so many possible combinations of strategies, which can
 be permutated for many different turn-orders, and since there can be anywhere
 between two and six players, this project demands parallel processing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we have said what our project goals are, it is also worth mentioning
 what they are NOT.
 We do not intend to develop any novel strategies, but rather we will stick
 to those we read about or have heard about (though our interpretation of
 known strategies may be a bit distinct).
 We will not be doing brute-force 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

look ahead
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We will not be considering alternate versions of the game rules.
 Finnally, we are not considering the psychologocal aspects of Risk--even
 though, in 3+ player risk, politics is a large part of strategy.
 However, much of the code in our project could obviously be re-cycled for
 such purposes.

Simulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using MPI, we made a master-slave model with the master issuing matchups
 and the slaves simulating those games and reporting the results back to
 the master.

\begin_layout Section
Intricacies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
In theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The start of the game can set you up for success or failure.
 The player must not underestimate the importance of their choices while
 claiming territories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Strategies are numerous.
 Watching your opponents' moves and attempting to understand what their
 intent is can be the key to victory.
 The AI that we implemented in our assessment of strategies was not advanced
 enough to emulate this kind of behavior.
 Given more time, this may have been possible through exhaustive searching.
 However, human intuition is more powerful than machinery when it comes
 to identifying deceit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
In practice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Representing the board internally was not too difficult.
 It ends up being an undirected graph.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, other parts of our design did end up taking a lot of time to conceptual
ize.
 We knew that we wanted to utilize the resources at our disposal and design
 a parallel algorithm.
 At first we thought that perhaps there was some parallelism that we could
 utilize within each simulated game.
 In fact, there is.
 Each 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

player
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or strategy could enumerate all of its possible moves and then make a decision.
 Nevertheless, we decided against implementing this since our primary desire
 was to treat a game as an atomic event and simulate each game in parallel
 so that we could discover at least a win/loss rate for each strategy.
 And we could not come to any conclusions with any desirable degree of confidenc
e without getting a large enough dataset.
 The large number of permutations of strategies (permutated, not merely
 combined, because player order can make a difference), as well as the large
 number of runs over which we must average to obtain reasonable results,
 is enough to demand parallelism even if each individual game is ran atomically.
 With more time, we may have further considered implementing both things,
 but as it stands this should suffice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We took a simple object-oriented approach to designing what a strategy would
 be.
 We designed an interface that each strategy would inherit from.
 All strategies would have to implement five functions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 claim()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 place()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 attack()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 defend()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 fortify()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each function mirrors one of the stages of the game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We would then run a game loop containing several strategies and we would
 pit them against each other to see which ones win out.
 In order for a strategy to make good decisions, we had to give it information
 about the board.
 We would have the game loop send a GameState object to each strategy when
 it called each of their functions.
 One option we had here was to add internal state to each of the strategies.
 Such state would be used for watching other players' tactics to try to
 counter them or to keep track of previous moves.
 To some degree or another, we did utilize this internal state.
 However, such use was perfunctory since getting a strategy to make intelligent
 decisions based on the game state alone was a significant challenge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Type of Strategies 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bad Strategy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to test our code and make sure everything was working, of course
 we had to make a very simple strategy.
 This strategy takes the first available location it finds while claiming,
 always attacks a set number of times per turn (or less), and generally
 does other mindless things.
 This strategy should lose to every other strategy except maybe the pacifist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Immediate Best Value
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This strategy weighs its decisions locally and chooses what it deems to
 be of the highest value.
 When considering where to attack, it uses this equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V=x_{1}T/B+x_{2}N\text{ }
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
T represents the troop bonus.
 B is the number of exposed borders.
 N is the number of neighboring regions.
 X is a scaling factor that determines how stable/expansive the strategy
 will be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Smallest Continent first
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A popular strategy where the player looks to claim either Australia or South
 America since they are easier to defend due to the limited number of paths
 into and out of them.
 It is easy to build up forces as there are only four territories to maintain
 and the troop bonus is advantageous.
 This strategy places troops on edges of its continents or near continents
 desired for conquering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Continents First
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This player strategically seeks to claim each continent and doesn’t branch
 out unless a continent can be claimed.
 This playstyle is defensive.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Territory First 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This player aims to prevent others from claiming continents by securing
 territories.
 This playstyle is aggressive.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Prey on the weak 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prey on the weak does what you'd expect.
 It targets the weakest bordering country.
 When placing, it always prefers the least-claimed continent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Prey on the strong 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Always attacks the owner of a continent, if possible, so that no extra points
 are gained.
 Chooses the strongest territory owned by the strongest opponent to attack,
 so long as two dice can still be used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Pacifist
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This strategy will never win, but it may perhaps outlive other strategies.
 It will be easy to determine if a strategy is far too aggressive by comparing
 it against this strategy.
 For example, if strategy A is knocked out of the game frequently before
 the pacifist strategy, then strategy A is too aggressive to be an effective
 strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Human Controlled
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For debugging purposes and getting a real feel for how certain strategies
 will play out.
 Matt played a quick game on a condensed map vs the smallest continents
 first strategy and lost.
 This provides evidence that the smallest continent first strategy works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Probability of outcomes 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your understanding of probabilities can greatly help your chances of not
 dying early on.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Best probability is having the attacker attack a defender with only one
 dice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This would be a great place to add Joseph's calculations.

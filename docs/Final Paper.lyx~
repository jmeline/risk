History
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Risk was originally produced by parker brothers, now a division of hasbro.
 It was invented by the French film director Albert Lamorisse in 1957 and
 it was originally called “The Conquest of the World.”
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The creator of the game anticipated that it should take 90 minutes to complete,
 but many players end up with the board occupying their tables for days
 at a time.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "key-3"

\end_inset

 With varying strategies and fragile alliances, Risk can be a drawn-out,
 yet intellectually fulfilling game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Rules
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Risk is a turn-based for two to six players.
 In the standard Risk Game, Earth has six continents and 42 regions.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the start of the game, players choose countries into which they place
 one army.
 This is the claiming phase.
 Only one army may be placed in any region during the claiming phase.
 At the beginning of each player's turn (after the claiming phase) they
 will receive bonus troops for continents that they own completely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After claiming, players will then place armies into regions that they own.
 This happens, again, one at a time until everyone has placed all their
 starting armies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then players may choose to attack other regions.
 They may only attack bordering regions.
 Attackers can use up to three dice, if they have at least three troops.
 Otherwise, they may only use one die for each troop.
 Defenders roll up to two dice.
 The attacker and the defender then sort their dice and compare them.
 (Attacker's highest vs defender's highest AND attacker's second highest
 vs defender's second highest) For each die that is greater in this comparison,
 that player kills one opposing army in the battle.
 Defenders win ties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In most versions of Risk, there is some sort of card system.
 Players could trade in cards for armies or attempt to accomplish some secret
 mission as dictated by the cards for an even larger army bonus.
 To simplify the problem that we were approaching, we decided to omit the
 use of cards in our project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Project Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many, many strategies for risk.
 What we have worked to do in this project is to compare several of those
 strategies: Some strategies work exceptionally well in one circumstance
 but perform poorly in another.
 Which strategies work against which, and is there actually any absolute
 winner? How likely are the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

best
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 algorithms to actually win? Are there loops in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dominion graph
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? Does it matter who gets the first move? These are some of the questions
 that we seek to answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to achieve all of this, we're going to need a LOT of data--thousands
 of runs for every condition-identical game we wish to assess--and each
 game may take a while to run.
 Since there are so many possible combinations of strategies, which can
 be permutated for many different turn-orders, and since there can be anywhere
 between two and six players, this project demands parallel processing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we have said what our project goals are, it is also worth mentioning
 what they are NOT.
 We do not intend to develop any novel strategies, but rather we will stick
 to those we read about or have heard about (though our interpretation of
 known strategies may be a bit distinct).
 We will not be doing brute-force 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

look ahead
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We will not be considering alternate versions of the game rules.
 Finnally, we are not considering the psychologocal aspects of Risk--even
 though, in 3+ player risk, politics is a large part of strategy.
 However, much of the code in our project could obviously be re-cycled for
 such purposes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Organization and Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Game Organization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We treat each match/game as an atomic event.
 The basic structure of a single game is shown here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to allow remote initilization of games, we provided factory methods
 to generate the appropriate map and strategies based on the identifiers
 found in a GameTask object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/layout2.bmp
	width 90col%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A game, once initiliazed, runs by repeatedly quiring the players' strategies
 to select actions and then by carrying out the requested action (for example,
 by using precalculated probabilities to simulate dice rolls and handle
 combat between regions).
 We took a simple object-oriented approach to designing what a strategy
 would be.
 We designed an interface that each strategy would inherit from.
 All strategies would have to implement four functions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 claim() -- used at the start of the game to claim land
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 place() -- used at the start of a player's turn to handle reinforcements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 attack() -- used repeatedly during a player's turn (until they player indicates
 that he/she is finished) to tell the Game which regions to make fight
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 fortify() -- used at the end of a player's turn to move troops around
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By implementing those four functions, each of which receives a copy of the
 game's current state, countless unique strategies may be formed.
 It is perfectly acceptable for each strategy to maintain an internal state,
 in order to track objectives, save time, or monitor trends.
 However, the strategies we implemented utilized only a very basic internal
 state.
 In several cases, our strategies included adjustable parameters that could
 be tweaked before launch (or by an inheriting class) in order to quickly
 form many new strategies based on one.
 While we provided this feature, we did not include it in our results graphs,
 as there were enough strategies implemented already.
 A discription of each strategy will be given below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides a GameState (which gives the ownership and troopcount of each region),
 both the strategies and the Game itself require a GameMap that defines
 connectivity between regions, as well as continents.
 This was easy to represent as a list of edges forming an undirected graph,
 plus a list of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

continents
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, each of which is a list of included nodes plus a value to be gained by
 owning all of those nodes.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the primary map of earth, we used two others in testing,
 one of which is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ThreeContinents
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 map shown here.
 Such maps are useful not only for testing, but for alternate analysis of
 strategies: Do those strategies that work well on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Earth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 map work well in general? However, while our program is fully equipped
 to answer this question, there was not time to re-gather all of the data
 for additional maps such as this.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Overall Organization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We could not come to any conclusions with any desirable degree of confidence
 without obtaining a sizeable dataset.
 The large number of permutations of strategies (permutated, not merely
 combined, because player order can make a difference), as well as the large
 number of runs over which we must average to obtain reasonable results,
 demands that we employ parallelism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We settled on a master-slave model, with the master (GameManager) issuing
 GameTasks to the GameSlaves and the slaves returning GameReports to the
 GameManager.
 In order to accomplish this, we serialized both the GameTask and the GameReport.
 The processor running the GameManager maintains a list of slaves (working
 and idle) and a list of incomplete tasks.
 After sending the initial GameTasks, the GameManager waits for reports
 and issues a new task each time one is received.
 Once all tasks are complete, a special GameTask consisting entirely of
 NOPLAYER strategies is used to signal to a slave that no additional work
 is required.
 By this means, the master and its slaves can all terminate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The contents of each GameReport are the ID of the map used that round, the
 IDs of the strategies used, an ordered list indicating which player won,
 which came in second, etc., and finnally a count of the number of rounds
 the game took to complete.
 This arrangement allows for maximum flexibility when doing analysis; the
 same data gathered can easily be used for multiply studies.
 The GameManager does not do any direct analysis, but rather aggregates
 all reports into a single output file.
 We are then free to analyze it by any means desired.
 Genearlly, a spreadsheet is quick and sufficiently powerful for our needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics

	width 90col%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After our first few strategies, we observed that each game ran considerably
 faster than expected, meaning that the overhead of MPI may have made our
 decision to task out each game an unprofitable one.
 It seems a more sensible division would be to let each slave run many games
 of a type and report back the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

average
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to spare the GameManager the effort.
 However, the meaning of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

average
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 depends on the experiment being performed--information such as the order
 in which the players were illiminated may be useful, for example, but would
 be lost in such a scheme.
 We were willing to sacrifice some speed for the increased data.
 However, as more sophistocated strategies were written, we soon found that
 this debate was not actually important: Games with advanced strategies
 do indeed take a lot longer to run (and games with particularly foolish
 strategies may experience the same effect), and we soon saw the overhead
 and work involved in MPI paying off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Type of Strategies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are countless possible strategies.
 However, we found that writing each one took much longer than anticipated,
 being something of a project in and of itself.
 However, a sufficient number were made as to be interesting, and several
 of those are adjustable, quickly allowing us to multiply the types of strategie
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These discriptions are not complete, and the .cpp file for each should be
 inspected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bad Strategy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to test our code and make sure everything was working, of course
 we had to make a very simple strategy.
 This strategy takes the first available location it finds while claiming,
 always attacks a set number of times per turn (or less), and generally
 does other mindless things.
 This strategy will likely lose to every other strategy except the Pacifist.
 In order to keep runtimes reasonable (since BadStrategy makes no concious
 attempt to win or end the game), BadStrategy was not included in the final
 all-vs-all, but initial testing indices that does indeed perform horendously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Immediate Best Value
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a greedy algorithm that assigns a score to its property and always
 takes the move that immediately maximizes that score.
 When assigning value, it uses this equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V=x_{1}T/B+x_{2}N\text{ }
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
T represents the troop bonus (due to number of regions owned and due to
 owned continents).
 B is the number of exposed borders, something that is usually sought to
 be minimized.
 However, there is also a merit in the opportunity to expant, which is represent
ed by N, the number of neighboring regions.
 X1 and X2 are scaling factors that reflect the strategies desire for stability
 vs opporunity; these two values are left adjustable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When attacking, the strategies does not consider only the value, but also
 the probability of victory; after multiplying V by this probability it
 may be found that it is better to attack a slightly less valuable location
 at which victory is more assured.
 Probabilities of victory are obtained via a static method of the Game class,
 which uses a cache to determine exact probabilities at low army counts,
 and approximations at higher army counts.
 It also considers an adjustable 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dangerThreshold
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to avoid leaving its borders unprotected.
 Reinforcements are placed near valuable-to-conquer locations in order to
 prepare for battle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Smallest Continent first
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A popular strategy where the player looks to claim either Australia or South
 America since they are easier to defend due to the limited number of paths
 into and out of them and due to the quick troop boost they can provide;
 perhaps more than any other this is a strategy whose success we are interested
 in guaging.
 It will attack rival on the smallest continent that it can reach.
 When placing reinforcements, is devides them (unequally, as determined
 by a formula involving the adjustable 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

attackPlacementPreferenceFactor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) between regions bordering the continent it wishes to conquer and the exposed
 borders of any continent already aquired, to keep its hold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Prey on the weak 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prey on the weak does what you'd expect: It targets the weakest bordering
 country to get a quick kill (or a seriese of them).
 It will attack as long as its foes are sufficiently weak and it is attacking
 with no fewer than three armies.
 Reinforcements are placed by the weakest opponents, in an attempt to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sweet
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 through as much enemy territory as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Pacifist
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This strategy will never win because it never attacks.
 But it may perhaps outlive other strategies.
 It will be easy to determine if a strategy is far too aggressive by comparing
 it against this strategy.
 For example, if strategy A is knocked out of the game frequently before
 the pacifist strategy, then strategy A is likely too aggressive to be an
 effective strategy.
 When placing, claiming, and reinforcing, the pacifist strategy picks arbitraril
y.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Aggressive
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have a character profile on this type: This player lost his job, failed
 his classes, and lost his girlfriend to his roommate.
 He is out for vengenance and is full out rage.
 Lacking any moral compass, he selects anyone to attack and will fight to
 the death, never turning down a fight, no matter how foolish.
 While this is a genearlly aimless strategy, it can overwhelm many strategies,
 and can be expected to shorten games in which it is involved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Human Controlled
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For debugging purposes and getting a real feel for how certain strategies
 will play out.
 This strategy uses a very simple textual user interface to display state
 and request user input.
 This strategy cannot, of course, be used in our final all-vs-all, but it
 provides a strong subjective measure of other strategies' values.
 For example, Matt played a quick game on a condensed map vs the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Smallest Continents First
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 strategy and lost.
 This provides evidence that the smallest continent first strategy can actually
 work in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 game against people.
 The Human Controlled Strategy is also fun.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Data Aquisition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Our chosen experiments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We decided on three primary experiments for this project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we wished to run a simple two-player all-vs-all set of matches in
 order to form a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dominion graph
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 By analyzing the dominion graph, we could determine whether there were
 any obvious winner or whether there were cycles.
 While a traditional dominion graph is binary and simply has an arrow on
 each edge, that does not accurately describe the situation here, so we
 include a probability alongside the arrow to indicate with what probabity
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

better
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of two strategies would win, since we cannot make binary sta
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, we wished to determine if player order has an effect on triumph.
 For each strategy, we pitted between 2 and 6 copies against itself and
 saw how often the first player won vs the second, third, etc.
 We also use the all-vs-all data to see whether the results between two
 distinct strategies were affected by which played first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finnally, we wished to analize the number of rounds required for victory.
 As with experiment #2, we conisder the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vs itself
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 data for 2-6 players and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vs others
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 data for two players.
 We are interested to know if all strategies prefer preemption or not, and
 whether a strategy that runs fast or slow vs itself does the same against
 others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Gathering the data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initially, we relied mostly on a test main() program to run games individually.
 As we became ready to use the GameManager, we needed a way to place orders
 for lists of tasks.
 To accomplish this, we wrote two generators that would take lists of strategies
 and maps and permutate them (with or without repetition) according to a
 number of players.
 We also used a bash script to split output between several files for merging
 later, in order to safely obtain large datasets without the need to precisely
 estimate runtime.
 Yet another bash script was responsible for launching the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vs self
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 games with every desired number of players.
 Data, once ready, was fed into pre-made Excel sheets for quick analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Experiment 1: Dominion Graph
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tragically, a simple mistake excluded the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Immediate Best Value
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 strategy from our results, leaving only four strategies, one of which was
 trivial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That pacifist always looses is to be expected.
 What is surprising, however, is that other strategies are fairly close
 to 50%; this is much less interesting than expected.
 More surprisingly still, the aggressive strategy ended up totally dominating,
 and there were no cycles: The order of expected victory is Aggressive,
 Smallest Continent First, Prey on the Weak, and Pacifist, but the the distincti
on between the first 3 is not very large.
 As we will see below, player order actually made a bigger difference than
 strategy in many cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Experiment 2: Order Advantage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For details, see 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Order Advantage study.xlsx
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 There were several interesting trends:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For Smallest Continent First vs itself, being the first player is actually
 the very worst outcome, unless there are only two players (in which case
 the first player wins 66% of the time.
 Beyond that, it was hard to recognize a pattern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For Agressive vs itself, for every number of players, the later you got
 your first turn the more likely you were to win, monatomically.
 This is very interesting, and is likely due to the fact that the agressive
 style spreads itself thin and as such is most vulnerable to attack right
 after its turn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For Prey on the Weak vs itself, the first player had the advantage every
 time, but the advantage very quickly became negligible as the number of
 players increased.
 This is likely due to the fact that a computer can easlity get trapped
 in a bad pattern: Those players who did not go first will tend not to bother
 the first player, who got the first reinforcements, and so they will distribute
 their forces around other players, leaving themselves open for attack.
 Indeed, it seems to make no difference whether one is second player or
 fifth; only the first player has an advantage.
 Prey on the Weak is intimidated by any show of muscle.
 Immediate Best exhibits the very same pattern; apperantly the multiplying-value
-by-probability-of-victory makes this stratigy similarly cowardly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When differing strategies competed in two player games, the first player
 always seems to usually have the advantage.
 This pattern was most apperant for aggressive vs Smallest Continent First,
 and least aperant for Smallest Continent First vs Prey on the Weak.
 It makes sense that the phenomena is less observed when 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Prey on the Weak
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is involved, because that strategy actually takes advantage of opponents'
 armies being reduced at the end of their turn.
 It also makes sense that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aggressive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 tends to increase the phenomena, as a head start makes a big difference
 in that mindless strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Experiment 3: Number of Rounds
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For details, see 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Order Advantage study.xlsx
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 There were several interesting trends:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
As should surprise no one, Aggressive finished the most quickly across the
 board and with a standard deviation of only ~35%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Prey on the Weak and ImmediateBest took a LOT longer than other strategies
 to finish in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vs itself
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 matches, and had a higher standard deviation percent.
 But in the latter's case, the percent deviation decreases with the nuber
 of players.
 In each case, 3-player games take a lot longer than 2-player ones, and
 4 takes longer than 3, but after that it's relatively stable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In mixed-strategy matches, Prey On the Weak continued to hugely inflate
 the number of rounds, while Aggressive reduced it; when the two were combined
 the game still took a very long time.
 The reason for the slowdown is likely because that combination of strategies
 would lead to the frequent changing of ownership of territories (and, unlike
 pure Aggressive vs Aggressive (where conquering is random), the conquering
 here tends to be of the same regions over an over as the weak are targeted,
 leaving only the strong to fight for the same territory again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the number of players playing didn't make as much of a difference
 as expected in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vs itself
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 match, but which strategy is used sure makes a big difference, and the
 patterns observed in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vs itself
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 matches carried over mor or less unchanged into mixed-strategy matches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Writing strategies, it seems, is much harder than anticipated.
 However, we found our program to be very useful and interesting.
 Thanks to it, we are able a qualitatively measure the fitness of strategies
 in comparison to one another, which reveals interesting trends that one
 would normally never have enough data to detect.

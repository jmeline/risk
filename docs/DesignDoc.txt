TODO:
	Run experiments descibed under "data needed"
	Crunch data - Joseph
	Write Report - see notes here


Stuff for report:
	each game runs faster than expected, so MPI overhead a bit pricy.  Oh well.
		A more sensible division would have each one run the same game a few times and report averages, rather than doing that centrally
			However, we don't just want the average, we want to be able to see the order of victory
			We sacrifice speed to keep maximum amounts of data
	Strategies much harder to develop than expected, SO
		Make parameter-adjustable so can get lots of cheap strats
	Change "Type of Strategies" section
		Use Jacob's funny discriptions of them from the comments
		Rename "Immediate Best Value" as greedy
		Kill Continents First and Territory First
		Add to report (and make) Agressive strategy:  Attack from strongest place, EVERY time possible
		Make "Prey on the weak" and "Pray on the Strong"
			fortunately, they _shouldn't_ be as hard as the others
			we don't have to do what's in the paper
		Update everything in the paper to match what we actually did
		Mention tweakability
	Focus on everything our program does; we can get all but the results in advance
	Mention MainTest vs TrueMain (and delete the 3rd executable; we never used it).  Say where used each

Data Needed/Stats to get/Reports to write:
	order advantage:
		have games with all the same strategy (2-6 players), and see how often p1, p2, etc wins, to see if there's an advantage.
	2-player total dominion graph:
		have each one be the starting player 50% of the time
			NOTE: do NOT allow pacifist vs pacifist
				careful with bogostrategy, too.
		go ahead and run with 2-6 players, since will need all the data anyhow.  We just will only dominion graph the 2p case
			Don't actually go to 6.  Start with 2 and go up
		Idea:  For 2-player, I can have 5x2=10 "strategies", considering greedy_p0 as different from greedy_p1...  I like that idea.
	Number of rounds it takes, as a function of players involved
		use same data as was used for dominion graph
		include standard deviation, or make a histogram
		We'll just do a 2 player version, for now.

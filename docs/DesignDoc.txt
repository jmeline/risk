Game/Strategy problems (definitely not a big deal at this stage):
	Controlling the number of troops to move into a newly conquered country
		Can be anywhere from numAttacking-numWhoDied to numInAttackingRegion-numWhoDied-1

Human Controlled Strategy problems:
	--Attacking: should ask where to attack from, not just where to
		As it is, it will sometimes try to attack from a non-touching region.  Test it on the Island map.
	--Could display state a little more often

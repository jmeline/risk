Goals:
DONE(1)Make Strategy Interface, UI, gameFlow, gameState, gameMap, gameReport
DONE(2)Make specific human-controlled strategies
x   (3)Organize Dominion Graph -> We'll do it by hand
no. (4)Analysis Program
    (5)Make it run on UberComputer
NO. (6)Crossover( Mixing and matching strategies to determine improvement)
    (7)Research and add strategies
DONE(8)Make Prez
    (9)Make Report


Pressing todo:
	4) Then test GameManager with MPI (check for file output)
	5) Then start the supercomputer running.
	6) Get some data

STRATEGY LIST:
	Human Controlled - DONE
	Smallest Continent First - DONE
		we can tweek parameters of this to make more strategie
	ImmediateBestValueStrategy1 - DONE
		we can tweek parameters of this to make more strategie
	Pacifist Strategy - done?
	
	"Bogo strategy" (replaces "Bad strategy")
		It looks like this may be a lot like pacifist strategy.
		Only advantage: bogo vs bogo _eventaully_ terminates
	Attack weak
		Always go for best odds of immediate victory
		"The weak" can mean 1) a player almost to be illuminated or 2) a region easily conquered
	Attack strong
		Don't let anyone size a continent
		Aside from that, calculate the greatest threat and hurt them
	Maximize V=x1*T/B+x2*N: Continents-first
		T=troop bonus; B=exposed borders; N=neighboring regions; x1 and x2 are scaling factors for stability vs having expansion options
		Goes for the continent of best V
	
		T=troop bonus; B=exposed borders; N=neighboring regions; x1 and x2 are scaling factors for stability vs having expansion options
		Goes for the best V right now, not caring as much for the long term (just test the V of every move)
	Region-First method
		Maximize the number of contigous regions owned, preferring that to continents
		Aside from maxmizing region count, seeks to maximize V=x1*T/B+x2*N
		Never less than two troops per region (so that doesn't have terrible odds when its borders broken)

Pressing todo:
DONE	2) Test the game
		When someone is completely conquered, it is not ending the game like it should
			debug to make sure that the "fallenPlayers" returned from doATurnOfBattles is what it should be
		There may be other bugs, but that's as far as I tested
	3) Then to test the GameManager all the way
		There should be an output file as a result; that's what we check
	4) Then GameManager with MPI
	5) Then start the supercomputer running.
	6) While it is, we can decide how to write the analyzer.

TODO:
	Run experiments, Crunch data, Write Report

	Mention MainTest vs TrueMain (and delete the 3rd executable; we never used it).
		Say where used each
	Mention the GameTask generators

	
	
	
Data Needed/Stats to get/Reports to write:
	order advantage:
		have games with all the same strategy (2-6 players), and see how often p1, p2, etc wins, to see if there's an advantage.
	2-player total dominion graph:
		go ahead and run with 2-6 players, since will need all the data anyhow.  We just will only dominion graph the 2p case
			Don't actually go to 6.  Start with 2 and go up
		Idea:  For 2-player, I can have 5x2=10 "strategies", considering greedy_p0 as different from greedy_p1...  I like that idea.
			Err, maybe not.
			Just put two values on each edge, depending on which player is first?
	Number of rounds it takes, as a function of players involved
		use same data as was used for dominion graph
		include standard deviation, or make a histogram
		We'll just do a 2 player version, for now.

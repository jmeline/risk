Stuff for report:
	each game runs faster than expected, so MPI overhead a bit pricy.  Oh well.
		A more sensible division would have each one run the same game a few times and report averages, rather than doing that centrally
			However, we don't just want the average, we want to be able to see the order of victory
			We sacrifice speed to keep maximum amounts of data
	Strategies much harder to develop than expected, SO
		Make parameter-adjustable so can get lots of cheap strats

Stats to get:
	order advantage:
		have games with all the same strategy (2-6 players), and see how often p1, p2, etc wins, to see if there's an advantage.
	2-player total dominion graph:
		have each one be the starting player 50% of the time
			NOTE: do NOT allow pacifist vs pacifist
				careful with bogostrategy, too.
		go ahead and run with 2-6 players, since will need all the data anyhow.  We just will only dominion graph the 2p case
			Don't actually go to 6.  Start with 2 and go up
	Number of rounds it takes, as a function of players involved
		use same data as was used for dominion graph


STRATEGY LIST:
	Human Controlled - DONE
	Smallest Continent First - DONE

	Pacifist Strategy - done?
	
	"Bogo strategy" (replaces "Bad strategy")
		It looks like this may be a lot like pacifist strategy.
		Only advantage: bogo vs bogo _eventaully_ terminates
	Attack weak
		Always go for best odds of immediate victory
		"The weak" can mean 1) a player almost to be illuminated or 2) a region easily conquered
	Attack strong
		Don't let anyone size a continent
		Aside from that, calculate the greatest threat and hurt them
	Maximize V=x1*T/B+x2*N: Continents-first
		T=troop bonus; B=exposed borders; N=neighboring regions; x1 and x2 are scaling factors for stability vs having expansion options
		Goes for the continent of best V
	
		T=troop bonus; B=exposed borders; N=neighboring regions; x1 and x2 are scaling factors for stability vs having expansion options
		Goes for the best V right now, not caring as much for the long term (just test the V of every move)
	Region-First method
		Maximize the number of contigous regions owned, preferring that to continents
		Aside from maxmizing region count, seeks to maximize V=x1*T/B+x2*N
		Never less than two troops per region (so that doesn't have terrible odds when its borders broken)

Goals:
DONE(1)Make Strategy Interface, UI, gameFlow, gameState, gameMap, gameReport
DONE(2)Make specific human-controlled strategies
    (3)Organize Dominion Graph
no. (4)Analysis Program
    (5)Make it run on UberComputer
NO. (6)Crossover( Mixing and matching strategies to determine improvement)
    (7)Research and add strategies
DONE(8)Make Prez
    (9)Make Report


Pressing todo:
DONE	2) Test the game
		When someone is completely conquered, it is not ending the game like it should
			debug to make sure that the "fallenPlayers" returned from doATurnOfBattles is what it should be
		There may be other bugs, but that's as far as I tested
	3) Then to test the GameManager all the way
		There should be an output file as a result; that's what we check
	4) Then GameManager with MPI
	5) Then start the supercomputer running.
	6) While it is, we can decide how to write the analyzer.

STRATEGY LIST:
	Human Controlled - DONE
	Smallest Continent First - DONE
	Pacifist Strategy - done?
	
	"Bogo strategy" (replaces "Bad strategy")
		It looks like this may be a lot like pacifist strategy.
		Only advantage: bogo vs bogo _eventaully_ terminates
	Attack weak
		Always go for best odds of immediate victory
		"The weak" can mean 1) a player almost to be illuminated or 2) a region easily conquered
	Attack strong
		Don't let anyone size a continent
		Aside from that, calculate the greatest threat and hurt them
	Maximize V=x1*T/B+x2*N: Continents-first
		T=troop bonus; B=exposed borders; N=neighboring regions; x1 and x2 are scaling factors for stability vs having expansion options
		Goes for the continent of best V
	Maximize V=x1*T/B+x2*N: Immediate action
		T=troop bonus; B=exposed borders; N=neighboring regions; x1 and x2 are scaling factors for stability vs having expansion options
		Goes for the best V right now, not caring as much for the long term (just test the V of every move)
	Region-First method
		Maximize the number of contigous regions owned, preferring that to continents
		Aside from maxmizing region count, seeks to maximize V=x1*T/B+x2*N
		Never less than two troops per region (so that doesn't have terrible odds when its borders broken)
